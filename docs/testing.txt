This was used as my testing copy. Which contains 6 rooms of different sizes, upto 20X25.
It doesn't have a set order of elements. It has either one or multiple spaces between elements.
Some of the lines have trailing spaces, while some don't.
It also contains errorous elements within a room. For example, line 6 has room dimension of 6X15, but the stairs element is said to be on 10,10.
It also contains duplicates (line 1 has 2 'g,10,11')

User is given error message when any one of 6 rooms is bigger than 20X25.
User is given error message when the file composes of wrong element information. (i.e. df2, k5,2)

When the rooms are printed, the printed material matches expectation.
There aren't any missing elements, nor extra elements on the screen.
For cases of errorous elements (such as 6X15 s10,10), stairs are moved to be in 6,10 rather than 10,10.
For cases of duplicates, the repeated element isn't shown in the screen.

In terms of hero moving from room to room, 

rooms are composed like following... 1    2    3
                                     4    5    6
                                     
The hero always moves around the rooms in a set order. 1->2->3->6->5->4->1 and repeat.

when q is pressed, the game ends right away. and inventory is printed on terminal.
